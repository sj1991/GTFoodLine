CS 4365 Enterprise Computing Project
The long wait times at the dining locations on campus are no longer a hidden truth. This leads to waste of time for the person standing in line and also discouraging other people to stand in the line and place the order thereby resulting in the losses for the vendors. In this project we propose a mobile application that allows the users to make orders and pay for them online and pick up the food at their selected pickup time. For a vendor, this app allows them to reallocate employees from the cash registers to the kitchen so that they can deal with large orders quickly and in an efficient way which will increase their profit margin. Data analysis can be performed on the userâ€™s history of transactions to make suggestions. As of now this app is catering to the needs of the Georgia Tech community since it only shows on campus dining options and also allows one to use Buzzfunds and Dining Dollars to pay for the meal. This model can applied at the enterprise level and across various industries. It could be used by schools, colleges, offices, living communities and other such society which will save the time of the customer as well as maximize the profits of the vendor.
